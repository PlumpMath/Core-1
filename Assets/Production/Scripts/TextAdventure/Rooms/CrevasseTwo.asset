  description: "You have managed to worm your head, torso and about one and a half
    arms into this small crack in a stone tunnel millions of light years from your
    home.  You pause for a moment to reflect on how your life led you here. The small
    alcove is illuminated by some glowing blue fungus which you hope is not toxic
    since its very close to your face. Nothing too interesting here for all this trouble.
    \ On the ground, just within reach there is a -SharpRock-.  There is not where
    to go but Back -west-.\r\n"
