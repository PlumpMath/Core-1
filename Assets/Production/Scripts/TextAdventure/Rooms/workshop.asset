  description: "You step into the circle.  Your vision blurs and you hear a bang.
    \ Then everything tastes purple for a moment.  You feel the sensation of floating
    and your heart lurches as you begin to fall.  You crash almost instantly onto
    a cold hard stone floor.  You seem to have landed in some kind of workshop.  \n\nYour
    head is spinning and the taste of dust fills your mouth. With a cough, you pull
    yourself up into a sitting position.  The air is still and smells foul. You look
    around the laboratory.  To the -North- there is a room that is pitch black. To
    the East there is a sealed -Container-.  Inside there is a glowing white Core
    that pulses with light every few seconds.  Your face breaks into a smirk.  This
    just got interesting. To the south there is a -Cabinet-. To the west there is
    Strange -Shape- against the wall."
