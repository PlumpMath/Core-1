  description: You reach into your bag and pull out your new flashlight.  It clicks
    to life and casts a strong beam of light into the darkness.  You hear a brief
    rustle from the room but see nothing.  Illuminated by the light you see a table
    with strange Glass -Rod-.  Next to the rod there is a another piece of paper with
    a final calculation scrawled across the middle of the page and circled.
