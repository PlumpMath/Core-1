  description: Well, no matter how high-tech the door, low tech solutions always seem
    to work. You jam the edge of the Crowbar into the Seam and pry the door open.
    There is a loud pop and the two halves of the door slowly slide into the side
    of the ship. There's not even a scratch on them from the crowbar. Score one for
    the neanderthal man. Now you can go -Inside-.
