  description: Much like the most ancient of explorers, you boldly stride into this
    ship and mentally claim it as your own.  You are the new master of this small
    domain. straight ahead there is an oddly shaped -Chair- in front of a -console-.
    As you look around the rest of the room, you realise it is much smaller than the
    outside would have you think. Really only enough space to examine and use. To
    the left there is a raised -dais-. To the right there is a strange -Machine-.
