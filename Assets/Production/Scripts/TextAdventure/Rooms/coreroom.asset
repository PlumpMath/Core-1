  description: You walk over to the strange glass Container and pull out your Glass
    Rod. A small hole at the bottom of the container looks like it would be the perfect
    fit. You slide the rod in and it snaps into place.  After a few minutes of fiddling
    with it you realize that it now functions as a handle.  You lift the rod and the
    front face of the glass slide up and into the lid of the container.  The pulsing
    white -Core- sits in front of you for the taking.
