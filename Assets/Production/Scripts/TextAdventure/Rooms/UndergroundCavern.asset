  description: "As you wanted deeper into the passage way, it begins to widen out
    into a Cavern. Great, that should give you some breathing room...or just give
    more space for any monsters to eat you. Your light shines back in the distance,
    almost as if off some kind of metal. As you continue to move towards it you notice
    the metal is actually a -Strange Ship-\r, you see the -engines- and a -door-\n"
