    the North there is a room that is pitch black. To the East there is a sealed -Container-.
    \ Inside there is a glowing orange Core that pulses with light every few seconds.
    \ Your face breaks into a smirk.  This just got interesting. To the south there
    is a Cabinet. To the west there is Strange Shape against the wall.\r"
