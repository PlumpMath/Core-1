  description: "With a brilliant flash of inspiration you pull the Sharp Rock out
    of your pack and run over to the crowbar.  You begin to chisel at the earth around
    the head of the crowbar until you can fit your fingers through.  With a mighty
    heave you rip the Crowbar free and crash ignominiously onto your backside. You
    take a moment, and several deep lungfuls of air, while you enjoy your prize. You
    should probably take the -crowbar- now.\r\n"
