  description: A pile of -Rocks- blocks your way. To the -East- there appears to be
    a small cave mouth, or is it a trick of the light? -South- of you lies the tunnel
    back to the Base Camp. Your -Radio- crackles faintly at your hip.
  roomName: cavein
  exits:
  - keyString: south
    exitDescription: Man you hate this job.  You consider just going back, but you
      pretty much just got here.  After much consideration you decide that a decent
      middle ground would be to at least report this cave-In on your -Radio- before
      you just leave.  Maybe they can send an excavation team or something.

  - keyString: east
    exitDescription: 'you glance to the east, long shadows stretch on the wall, and
      a section appears darker than the rough grey of the stone.  You suspect there''s
      a small opening there, just big enough to squeeze through '
