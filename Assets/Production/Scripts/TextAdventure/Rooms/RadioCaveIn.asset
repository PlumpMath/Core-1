  description: "You radio back to Base Camp and tell them there is what appears to
    be a cave in.  You get the unhelpful reply: \u201CWhat do you expect me to do?
    see what you can do to get past it.  If you cannot figure it out come back here
    and we can send another worker. Of course that would mean we have pretty much
    no reason to leave you alive...so..yea.\u201D\r\n\nGuess there is no reason to
    go back. May as well continue on. A pile of -Rocks- blocks your way. To the -East-
    there appears to be a small cave mouth, or is it a trick of the light?"
