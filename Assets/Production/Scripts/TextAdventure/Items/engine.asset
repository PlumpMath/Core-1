    textResponse: These are unlike any Engine you have ever seen before.  They are
      large and have a peculiar shape ending at a rather small hole.  Your cannot
      fathom how these could even move this ship based on everything you know of physics.
      You definitely need to take this ship for a spin now, if only you could get
      these engines to fire, that'd be hot!
