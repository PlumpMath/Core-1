    textResponse: ' A large machine sites here, cold and dark. It is covered in strange
      -Characters- you do not recognize along with many important looking gauges that
      sit lifeless. A small slit sits next to a big Red -Button- that''s almost begging
      you to push it. The machine is connected to a strange console, with an open
      panel.  This panel seems to be damaged, some of the wires have been snapped.'
