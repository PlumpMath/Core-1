    textResponse: This shit is unlike anything you have seen before. It is made of
      some unrecognizable alloy, and whoever did the design work knows how to make
      a bitchin' spaceship. You give a low whistle and glance at your radio. No way
      you are going to report this one, this puppy's all yours. The spaceship's -Engines-
      lay silent.  You also see that there is a -Door-.
