    textResponse: You walk to the Console.  This has seen better days.  It looks like
      its a communication array that was cracked open in the crash.  Well, at least
      you don't need communications its not like you could speak to these aliens even
      if any had survived.  Just inside the crack you can make our some -Wires-.  If
      you wanted to put on your electricians hat you could maybe get something working
      in this wreck.  Actually electricians make more than you, would this qualify
      for specialty pay? You make a note to ask about that once you get back.
