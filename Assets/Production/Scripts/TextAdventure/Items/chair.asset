    textResponse: "A strangely shaped chair sits facing the center console. You look
      if over from all angles, but it doesn't seem like you could possibly sit in
      this chair.  After much consideration you decide that you are lacking in the
      amount of legs required to use this chair.  Your body would not sit comfortably.
      \ You expect that that previous owner had no less than four more legs than you
      do. No way around it, this chair has to go.  You should be able to sit comfortably
      in your new ship.\r\n"
