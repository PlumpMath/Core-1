    textResponse: "You need those keys don't you.  Of course you do.  You steel yourself
      and before you have the time to think twice dart forward and slip a hand under
      the body to grab the keys.  The underside of the body is slick and your hand
      slides in easily.  You try not to think about what is on your hand as you slip
      your prize into your pocket\r\n"

    textResponse: You turn to the Cabinet in the corner and try keys until one slides
      in.  Bingo.  A sharp flick of your wrist and the lock snaps open.  You crack
      the doors and peer inside.  Piles of illegible paperwork sit stacked on all
      shelves.  On the left hand side of the middle shelf, buried under notes and
      calculations sits a -Flashlight-.
