    textResponse: You go closer to the strange shape to get a closer look.  The smell
      hits you first, its foulness overshadowed only by the creature's appearance.
      It appears as if this is a giant bug, as large as a man.  You look at its six
      spindly legs curled up against its humongous thorax and your mind flashes back  to
      the strange seat you saw on the ship.  This is getting freaky.  You didn't sign
      up for giant alien bugs.  Its face will haunt your memory until your last breath.  With
      a shudder you drop to your knees and empty your stomach in fear. A -Glint- catches
      your eye.
