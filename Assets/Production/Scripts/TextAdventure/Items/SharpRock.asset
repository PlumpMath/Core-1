    textResponse: Its a rock. Its solid, grey and about the size of your fist.  One
      side has a sharp point as if it were sheered off from a bigger rock. You suspect
      that it was most likely broken by...say two rocks hitting each other while falling.

    textResponse: Perfect. You have always wanted a rock collection. What better day
      than today. After all your certain you will make it out of this tunnel and they
      did not send you off to certain doom. You stretch your arms out and grasp the
      pointy rock; by the non-pointy end of course.

    textResponse: With a brilliant flash of inspiration you pull the Sharp Rock out
      of your pack and run over to the crowbar.  You begin to chisel at the earth
      around the head of the crowbar until you can fit your fingers through.  With
      a mighty heave you rip the -crowbar- free and crash ignominiously onto your
      backside. You take a moment, and several deep lungfuls of air, while you enjoy
      your prize. You should probably take the -crowbar- now.
