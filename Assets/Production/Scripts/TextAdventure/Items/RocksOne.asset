    textResponse: "A large mound of debris lays between you and...whatever you're
      looking for.  If you wish to proceeded you will need a way to remove these rocks.
      You search around for any points of weakness, however each looks to be as sturdy
      as the last.  You do see something -metal- that appears wedged between some
      of the bigger boulders at an awkward angle. If only you had some leverage.\r\n"

    textResponse: You look at the pile of rocks and your meager tools and with a small
      shrug hitch up your pants.  You brace your shoulder against a boulder that looks
      likely to move and heave. And heave. And heave.  The rock refuses to budge.  They
      don't pay you enough for this. Frustrated you kick at the pile of rocks, which
      gives a smug little rustle but does not budge. Now your foot hurts. Great.
