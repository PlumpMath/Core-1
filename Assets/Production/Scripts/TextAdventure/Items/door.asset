    textResponse: "You walk up the ramp to what appears to be a door, however it won\u2019t
      budge.  The Door is made from the same mysterious metal as the rest of the ship.
      You are pretty sure this is a big discovery, like noble prize level. If only
      you could get inside this would be even better.  Despite your wishes, the doors
      remain closed.  Figures, even in the future nothing works.\nThis door seems
      like many of its kind you have seen before.  Solid, metal, resolutely standing
      between you and the interior of this ship.  Like all doors the sole purpose
      is to keep you from the other side.  This door in particular seems well suited
      to its task. Aside from the small -Seam- where the two sides meet to form this
      majestic display of doorhood there is nary a crack or crevasse to be seen."
