    textResponse: It is your own personal hero of light.  In  your haste your knock
      a handful of the pages. Hopefully those weren't in a special order, but you

    textResponse: "You turn to the Cabinet in the corner and try keys until one slides
      in.  Bingo.  A sharp flick of your wrist and the lock snaps open.  You crack
      the doors and peer inside.  Piles of illegible paperwork sit stacked on all
      shelves.  On the left hand side of the middle shelf, buried under notes and
      calculations sits a -Flashlight-.\r\n"
