      used to play. Something to do with creatures that latch onto your face.

    textResponse: "You reach into your pack and take out the Crowbar.  With a devil
      may care attitude you shove it into the rock pile at the small stone you believe
      to be a lynch pin.  With a grunt and a heave you send the whole pile tumbling
      around you.  A cacophony of falling rocks kicks a large cloud of dust into the
      air and for a brief moment your heart leaps to your throat.  You see your life
      flash before your eyes and realize that you could have lived a much better life.
      \ For starters you should never have taken this job.  Within less than a minute
      the last of the large boulders have finished falling, and you remain miraculously
      un-squashed. Man are you glad you wore those lucky underwear today. There is
      now a path to the -west-\r\n"
