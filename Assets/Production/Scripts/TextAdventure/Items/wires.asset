    textResponse: "Lucky for you, you were not in fact sleeping through every electronics
      class during your mandatory education years. You quickly use the wires to patch

      \u201CBattery Backup\u201D and surprisingly the control panel comes to life.
      That button is now brightly shinning and beckoning to you."
